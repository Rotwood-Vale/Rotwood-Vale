Elfkeep is a modified Roguetown 2 Map using Rotwood-Vale. 

- Treegen is high.
- Light in the forest is intentionally low.
- Adventurers spawn in the keep right next to the king on roundstart. 
- There are no town guards implemented yet, as the adventurers run all the businesses, etc. 
- The map requires teleportation zones and has many areas that can utilize them to interact with other maps from every side of the world! (North T.B.A)


- Designed as a Wood-Elf City where racism is barely an issue; built on a long-lost mythical ruin somewhere near the Dream-Realm connected to Ratwood; 
Elfkeep is also often known as 'Dreamkeep' collectively; a place where many can relax, Roleplay and otherwise find peace as an Oasis away from many of the issues of the mainmap.
It is to be considered 'A Hotel' for IC/RP Interactions designed to govern itself. PVE+PVE. 
(Works as a PvP Deathmatch if all townie roles are removed and adventurers are set to maximum. They all spawn in the throneroom for RP reasons..
But this also causes them to potentially all RDM each other immediately for the crown, thus causing Adventurer-King Early Game. Or King of the Hedge, I suppose!)

ENJOY! Big thanks to Lollthpilled for the inspiration, as well as Stonekeep and my own personal enjoyment doing this. 
I hope it inspires you all as much as it did for me to create it.
