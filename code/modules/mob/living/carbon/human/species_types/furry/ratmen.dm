	The Rodent-Like Rodeetch are a race that had faced the rise and fall of their grand capital and survived with a distinct and deep religious divide. \
	Once they were considered no more than Demi-humans that only appeared during the darkest hours of the night to steal and kill, until the one day they broke out of their hovels during the midday sun. \
	Enraptured by the allure of gold in the sky, they built up a city constructed from their previous ill gotten gains, spires of gold and homes of marble, where they worshipped Astrata.<br><br>\
	But lo, did the calling of their old goddess creep into their ears, clawing at the mortar of their empire and their minds. \
	Kretch struck the final blow to their foundations, resulting in 'The Final Feast' that ruined their kingdom, burned their halls, and saw their king cannibalized by his people. \
	Today Rodeetch are nothing more than Vagabonds that can never find themselves settled and organized for long. \
	Astrata promises succor, and Kretch subverts it every time."
